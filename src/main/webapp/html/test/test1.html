							an ordinary (heap-organized) table, data for an index-organized
							table is stored in a B-tree index structure in a primary key
							sorted manner. Besides storing the primary key column values of
							an index-organized table row, each index entry in the B-tree
							stores the nonkey column values as well.

						<td class="cellalignment2685" headers="r5c1-t3 r1c2-t3">Partitioned
							tables enable your data to be broken down into smaller, more
							manageable pieces called partitions, or even subpartitions. Each
							partition can have separate physical attributes, such as
							compression enabled or disabled, type of compression, physical
							storage settings, and tablespace, thus providing a structure that
							can be better tuned for availability and performance. In
							addition, each partition can be managed individually, which can
							simplify and reduce the time required for backup and
							administration.
