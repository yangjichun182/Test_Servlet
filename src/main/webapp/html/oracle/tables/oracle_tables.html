	<h1>表分类</h1>
	<p>The most common type of table in an Oracle database is a
		relational table, which is structured with simple columns similar to
		the employees table. Two other table types are supported: object
		tables and XMLType tables. Any of the three table types can be defined
		as permanent or temporary[临时的]. Temporary tables hold session-private
		data that exists only for the duration of a transaction[事务] or
		session. They are useful in applications where a results set must be
		held temporarily in memory, perhaps because the results set is
		constructed by running multiple operations. You can build relational
		tables in either heap or index-organized structures. In heap
		structures, the rows are not stored in any particular order. In
		index-organized tables, the row order is determined by the values in
		one or more selected columns. For some applications, index-organized
		tables provide enhanced【增强，加强】 performance and more efficient use of
		disk space. This section describes permanent, heap-organized
		tables【堆表】. For information about other table types and when to use
		them, see Oracle Database Administrator's Guide, Oracle Database
		Concepts , and Oracle Database Performance Tuning Guide . For the
		syntax required to create and alter tables with SQL。</p>

	<p>the types of tables that you can create:</p>
	<table class="cellalignment2683" title="Table Varieties"
		summary="Column 1 lists some of the various types of tables, column 2 describes each type of table.">

		<tr class="cellalignment2677">
			<th class="cellalignment2684" id="r1c1-t3">Type of Table</th>

		<tbody>
			<tr class="cellalignment2677">
				<td class="cellalignment2685">Ordinary (heap-organized) table</td>
				<td class="cellalignment2685">This is the basic, general
					purpose type of table which is the primary subject of this chapter.
					Its data is stored as an unordered collection (heap).</td>
			</tr>
			<tr class="cellalignment2677">
				<td class="cellalignment2685">Clustered table</td>
				<td class="cellalignment2685">A clustered table is a table that
					is part of a cluster. A cluster is a group of tables that share the
					same data blocks because they share common columns and are often
					used together.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr class="cellalignment2677">
				<td class="cellalignment2685">Partitioned table</td>
				<td class="cellalignment2685">Partitioned tables enable your
					data to be broken down into smaller, more manageable pieces called
					partitions, or even subpartitions. Each partition can have separate
					physical attributes, such as compression enabled or disabled, type
					of compression, physical storage settings, and tablespace, thus
					providing a structure that can be better tuned for availability and
					performance. In addition, each partition can be managed
					individually, which can simplify and reduce the time required for
					backup and administration.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr class="cellalignment2677">
				<td class="cellalignment2685">Index-organized table</td>
				<td class="cellalignment2685">Unlike an ordinary
					(heap-organized) table, data for an index-organized table is stored
					in a B-tree index structure in a primary key sorted manner. Besides
					storing the primary key column values of an index-organized table
					row, each index entry in the B-tree stores the nonkey column values
					as well.</td>
